Problem to be completed during Industry Prep - Interview Prep activity time

## Problem Statement

You are given a data structure containing information about albums that artists have released. It will be an unordered list of tuples, where each tuple will represent a single album. The tuple will have three elements in this order: artist name, album name, and release year. Note that the list is NOT in chronological order.

For example:

```py
[
    ("Rodrigo y Gabriela", "9 Dead Alive", 2014),
    ("Shakira", "El Dorado", 2017),
    ("Janelle Mon치e", "The ArchAndroid", 2010),
    ("Shakira", "Magia", 1991),
    ("Shakira", "She Wolf", 2009),
    ("Rodrigo y Gabriela", "11:11", 2009),
    ("Rodrigo y Gabriela", "Rodrigo y Gabriela", 2006),
    ("Rodrigo y Gabriela", "Mettavolution", 2019),
    ("Janelle Mon치e", "Dirty Computer", 2018)
]
```

The difference in time between Shakira's first released album and last released album is 26 years (1991 to 2017). This is the largest difference of any of the listed artists. Thus, we say that Shakira has the most longevity of any of the listed artists.

Write a function that accepts a list of albums and returns a tuple containing the artist with the most longevity and difference in time between their first and last album.

## Examples

### Example 1
```py
albums_1 = [
    ("Rodrigo y Gabriela", "9 Dead Alive", 2014),
    ("Shakira", "El Dorado", 2017),
    ("Janelle Mon치e", "The ArchAndroid", 2010),
    ("Shakira", "Magia", 1991),
    ("Shakira", "She Wolf", 2009),
    ("Rodrigo y Gabriela", "11:11", 2009),
    ("Rodrigo y Gabriela", "Rodrigo y Gabriela", 2006),
    ("Rodrigo y Gabriela", "Mettavolution", 2019),
    ("Janelle Mon치e", "Dirty Computer", 2018)
]

longest_career(albums_1)
```
Produces
```py
("Shakira", 26)
```

### Example 2
```py
albums_2 = [
    ("Skylar Kergil", "Tell Me a Story", 2015),
    ("Lil Nas X", "Old Town Road", 2018),
    ("Skylar Kergil", "Thank You", 2013),
    ("Lil Nas X", "Montero", 2021),
]

longest_career(albums_2)
```
Produces
```py
("Lil Nas X", 3)
```
